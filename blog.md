Mineclone - A Blog
==================

###I'm going to talk about this
####Feb 27, 2014
Yesterday I pushed my mineclone code for the first time. I'm going to blog about my experiences writing mineclone because I want to understand everything I can about Minecraft and how it's made.


###Just thought I'd mention

Of course, one of the first things I did was to look around GitHub for other people's MC clones. There are some good ones out there, and it makes me think that my own repo isn't much of anything. After all, some of them are fully-formed, downloadable, and playable. 

Mine's more like a little toy. But I'm actually OK with that right now. What I've written I've got to run in the command line and I'm happy. Right now it just shows blocks placed (in 2D) according to probability. No fancy noise generation yet. And I've not yet cleaned up the 'impossible' blocks, such as solid matter hanging suspended in mid-air.
